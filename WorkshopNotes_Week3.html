**Nov. 19**

The analog coding exercise:
- depending on the person, different categories of words were used. 
- The question itself provides specific types of answers, with Betty choosing to talk about her co-worker's backgrounds.

- Can a computer program take in the context that we were able to in a short period, or can it just do things such as count frequency?
    - this is however one of the big motives for a computational approach, in being able to take large amounts of text and analyzing it all at once.

Jupyter Notebook notes
- Sometimes the kernal will change out of the miniconda environemnt. This can cause errors, so double check for that. 
- **Questions**
    - 1. The code is analyzing a text, ignoring a set of words, and then counting the frequency and placing words in a different document. 
    - 2. It seems to be a text analysis problem?
    - 3. First it seems to define the document its working in, then noting how many words to remove, then defining the words to ignore, changing the words from a string to a list, then placing the significant words in their own set, which are then ordered by frequency.
