# Notes For Coding for Humanities Workshop

### Nov. 11

#### Markdown examples

This workshop module focused on the basics of the command line, using markup formats (markdown) and submitting files with Git. 
- Just for the purpose of examples, here is how to **bold** text, and here is how to _italicize_ text. 
- Text can also be **_both_**.
- Markdown can link websites like [like so.](https://dh-coding-docs.netlify.app)
- It can also form 
> a quote
- Markdown can also have code inserted in text, or have a photo inserted by inserting the link by doing so:
![Cat](https://images.pexels.com/photos/104827/cat-pet-animal-domestic-104827.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1)

- Images can also be inserted by putting the photo in the same directory, and referencing it. 
  - Like So:
![Cat](CatPhoto-104827.jpg)

#### Workshop Notes

- Thus far, this has been review for me, though it has been rather helpful. 
- We will also be learning to embed a video, which is more new to me. 
  - Scratch that, we gave up on the html embed. 
- Static sites can be very customized (and they're free!)
  - These sites can work as an academic CV.

- Learned to create a readme file in git using the command line. 

Commands needed are 
  - git commit add -A
  - git commit -m "commit message"
  - git push
